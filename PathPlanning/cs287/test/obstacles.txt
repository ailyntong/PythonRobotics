rr = 0.5

Circle path as described in LaValle book:
obstacles = [(30, 35, 28),
                 (0, 0, 15),
                 (60, 0, 15)]
params = generate_params(obstacles, 0, 60, 60, 60, rr)

Spiral path from original code:
obstacles = [
     (20, 20, 4),
     (12, 24, 8),
     (12, 32, 8),
     (12, 40, 8),
     (28, 20, 8),
     (36, 20, 8),
     (32, 40, 4)
] 
params = generate_params(obstacles, 20, 10, 23, 30, rr)
